# Smart Contract and No Collateral Credit for Informal Sector Businesses in Africa 

Individual businesses in the informal sector form various co-operative to contribute flat fee into a pool fund (savings mobilization) on weekly or monthly basis. This amount is then given to a one member from among the co-operative group. This would continue until all members within a co-operative group receive funds from the pool fund when their turn is due to end the cycle of the pool fund. 

This practice has sustained informal businesses till present day Africa and the sector remains the backbone of economies in Africa. In such co-operative system no collateral is needed to receive funds from the co-operative pool but solely on mutual cooperation basis. The smart-contract would provide an imprint of cooperative operation on the Cardano blockchain. 

The smart-contract would function to allow players in the informal sectors undertake the follow;

> * Form co-operative groups of 3, 5 and 7 to access financial credit
> * he group formed would serve as a security for credit and there would be no need for collateral
> * Individuals in the group getting more and high credit is dependent on the performance of all group members in repaying the loans.
> * Governance mechanic exist to resolve real situation of set-back, justifiable bad debt and participatory recovery plan.

The credit would not be given in isolation as plans exist to provide identity and accounting management to help business get credit ratings that can be an indicator to rely on for future access to credit.
