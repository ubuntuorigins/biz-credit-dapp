# Background

The blockchain provides the platform for Africa’s informal sector to put its deep rooted traditional co-operative system used to provide credit to informal businesses. 

It is public knowledge that Cardano blockchain has Africa as part of its strategic goal. To fully explore the potential of Africa’s market share, we cannot afford to ignore the informal sector in Africa. 

The informal sector is the engine for economic growth and employs 90% of youths in Africa, yet development agenda in Africa and from multilateral development partners seems to ignore the very engine of economic growth in Africa. 

This proposal seeks to provide financial inclusion by providing credit to businesses in the informal sector. It is stablished that the development of informal sector is a great accelerator towards solving critical socio-economic problems, including Poverty, hunger, improving standard of living among others. Among the challenges faced by the informal sector, financing businesses or access to credit is a huge problem (Lader, 1996). 

Existing credit facilities and bank do not have financial products for businesses in the informal sector. This is due to the sectors inability to document its activity or provide easy identification for its players as well as inability to raise the needed collateral to secure loans or credit from banks, micro finance and financial institutions. Financial institutions with the formal sector structure their product to meet the needs of large corporations. 

There is also element of discrimination with the credit constraints which depends gender disparity gap. Abor and Biekpe (2006) identified that female owned businesses in the informal sector are relatively small and less likely to employ debt finance. This is because, the necessary collateral to qualify for debt finance is not owned in their names and females are unable to penetrate informal financial network which affect their ability to gain useful information and source of capital (Greene et al, 1999).
