# Risk Assessment

The proposal tackles a need which has been the difficulty challenge facing the informal businesses in Africa. Despite its positive enthusiasm, the team foresees that the low levels of education would and digital connectivity would be a major challenge for the project. However, we plan to mitigate the risks associated with internet connectivity by focusing on the urban informal sector and gradually expand to rural areas with time. 

The team would also provide periodic educational outreach and annual event to constantly engage individuals in the informal sector and facilitate easy use of dApp, governance and resolve challenges. These outreach events are categorized as follows;

* Ubuntu Convention – This is would be an annual event organized once a year.
Ubuntu Outreach – This would be quarterly event organized four times year. 
* Ubuntu Family Event – This would be a self-initiated event that would be organize by individuals in the informal sector depending on their own needs. 

> Ubuntu Origins Africa as an organization would provide resources including personal to educate locals at various organize strategic events. 

Also, there is an increase number of graduate unemployment in Africa and these graduates would be provided the opportunity to serve as agents and assist businesses owners in the informal sector to facilitate easy use of dApp.
