# Addressing the Challenge

The proposal provides blockchain and decentralized solution to a critical and unique niche within the African continent thus the informal sector. The informal sector has the ability to scale up ADA use and adoption rapidly in the face of competition from other ecosystem in the crypto market share of Africa. 

The credit would be paid in ADA value and allow players in the informal sector to use Yoroi wallet to receive credit facility to support their businesses. This would provide an evidence-based support and development of real businesses and grow cryptocurrency trust among real business owners. This would be easy to building grounds in the long run to adopt Cardano for real world business value delivering. 

The proposal provides a win-win situation for players in the informal sector by address the problem of lack of access to credit by informal sector players and making Cardano adoption accelerate on the African continent. Developments of informal sector in Africa has huge tendency of accelerating adoption and hence should be given needed attention because blockchain technology exist to providing self-governance to the informal sector that abhors control from centralized authority. 

Through smart-contract with businesses in the informal sector, the future of growth in adopting Cardano in Africa would accelerate since this proposal presents solution to the informal sector which is the engine of economic activities in Africa.
